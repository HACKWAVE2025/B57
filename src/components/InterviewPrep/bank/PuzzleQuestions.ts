    category: "logical",
    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "general",
    sampleAnswer: "Use one die with faces 0,1,2,3,4,5 and another with faces 0,1,2,6,7,8. The key insight is that 6 and 9 are the same when rotated, so one face can represent both. This allows representing all numbers from 01 to 31.",

    category: "logical",
    difficulty: "hard",
    type: "general",
    sampleAnswer: "Use dynamic programming approach. The optimal strategy involves dropping the first egg at floor 14, then 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100. If it breaks at any floor, use the second egg to test floors sequentially from the last safe floor. This guarantees finding the answer in at most 14 drops.",

    category: "logical",
    difficulty: "medium",

    sampleAnswer: "Yes, you should switch. Initially, your door has 1/3 probability of having the prize.

    sampleAnswer: "It's easier to calculate the probability that all birthdays are different, then subtract from 1. P(all different) = (365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * (343/365) ≈ 0.493. So P(at least one match) ≈ 0.507 or about 50.7%.",

    difficulty: "medium",
    type: "general",
    sampleAnswer: "Only lockers that are perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...) remain open. This is because a locker is toggled by all its divisors, and only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors (since one divisor - the square root - is counted once instead of twice).",

Since person A doesn't immediately answer, persons B and C know A sees two blue hats. By the same logic, when B doesn't immediately answer, C deduces they all have blue hats.",
